# 🚀 SHL Assessment Recommendation System  
### Re-Ranking Based Generative AI Project  
**Author:** Amaan Ali  
**Institution:** Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna  

---

## 🧠 Overview  
This project was developed as part of the **SHL AI Intern (Generative AI)** assignment.  
The goal was to build an intelligent **recommendation system** that suggests the most relevant **SHL assessments** based on a given **job description or short text query**.  

Instead of relying on basic keyword search, the system understands the **context and intent** behind a recruiter’s query — recommending assessments that align with both **technical** and **behavioral** requirements.  

The project focuses on improving **Mean Recall@10** through multiple optimization stages including **semantic retrieval**, **re-ranking**, and **hybrid scoring**.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- 🔹 **End-to-end working web app** — input a query and instantly get relevant SHL assessments.  
- 🔹 **Semantic understanding** using transformer embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).  
- 🔹 **Cross-Encoder re-ranking** for improved contextual matching.  
- 🔹 **Hybrid scoring** combining semantic similarity, keyword overlap, and intent boosting.  
- 🔹 **Optimized performance** with precomputed embeddings (~0.7 s/query on CPU).

## 📈 Project Performance  

| **Stage** | **Optimization** | **Mean Recall@10** |
|------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Baseline | Bi-Encoder (semantic only) | 0.1611 |
| + Cross-Encoder Re-Ranking | Contextual Scoring | 0.2203 |
| + Multi-Signal Fusion | Final Optimized Model | **0.2422** |

✅ The final system achieved roughly a **50% improvement in Recall@10** compared to the baseline.

## 🧩 System Architecture  

**User Query -> Bi-Encoder Retrieval -> Cross-Encoder Re-Ranking -> Multi-Signal Fusion -> Top-k SHL Assessments (returned as JSON)**

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
1-git clone https://github.com/Amaan-ali03/SHL-recommendation-Re-Ranking-Based-.git
2-python3 -m venv .venv
3-source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
# OR
.venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
4-cd SHL-recommendation-Re-Ranking-Based-
5-cd src
6-pip install -r requirements.txt
7-**uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload**
**Check health endpoint:
👉** http://127.0.0.1:8000/health**
Expected output:**
{"status": "healthy"}
8-cd ..
9-python -m http.server --directory src/frontend 3000
Then open in your browser:
👉** http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html**
You’ll see the frontend connected to the backend.
Enter a query, and it will send a request to the /recommend endpoint and display the top suggested assessments.
```
## 🧪 Example API Call  

**Endpoint:**  
```bash
POST https://amaanaliii-shl-recommendation.hf.space/recommend
Request Body:
{
  "query": "Hiring a mid-level Java developer who can work with business teams",
  "k": 10
}
Response:
{
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "Java Developer Skills Test",
      "url": "https://www.shl.com/.../java-developer-test",
      "test_type": "K"
    },
    {
      "name": "Teamwork & Collaboration Assessment",
      "url": "https://www.shl.com/.../teamwork-assessment",
      "test_type": "P"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Summary 
This project demonstrates how semantic retrieval and re-ranking can enhance candidate assessment recommendations for recruiters.
By combining transformer embeddings with contextual and lexical cues, the system achieved a 50% boost in accuracy — while remaining lightweight enough to run efficiently on CPU.
It is fully functional, deployed, and ready for end-to-end testing
